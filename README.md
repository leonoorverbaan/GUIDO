# GUIDO: Guiding User-friendly Independent Driving Object
# Biomechanotronics GUIDO

This project contains 3 designs for a path-planning Robot Guidance Dog. For Design 1 and Design 2, there are simulations that demonstrate how path planning is implemented in the GUIDO prototypes.

---

## Getting Started

Learn more about these prototypes by reading the detailed technical paper here: [GUIDO.pdf](https://github.com/leonoorverbaan/Written-technical-papers/blob/main/GUIDO.pdf). These prototypes include both path-planning and haptic software (cane, remote, and robot guidance dog). Keep in mind that these are prototypes and not fully developed products!


## Test out the simulations per design

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the repository using Git:
```
  git clone https://github.com/leonoorverbaan/GUIDO.git
  cd GUIDO
```
